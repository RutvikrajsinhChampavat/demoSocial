## About  

It is Repository created to work on our technical skills and purpose of learning.
Basically trying to create social media application and hope to launch in soon.  

A twitter-like social media site where anyone can post 240-character texts (future: images), and people can reply, like or reshare the posts.
Users can follow each other. The home feed shows posts from users that they follow.
Users will be notified when someone likes their posts, replies or reshares them and when someone follows them.  
Users and posts can be searched.
